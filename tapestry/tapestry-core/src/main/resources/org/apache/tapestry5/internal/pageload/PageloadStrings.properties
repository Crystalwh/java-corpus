unique_mixin_required=Mixins applied to a component must be unique. Mixin '%s' has already been applied.
missing_component_type=You must specify the type via t:type, the element, or @Component annotation.
no_more_tokens=No more template tokens.
could_not_find_override=Could not find an override for extension point '%s'.
no_parent_for_extension=Component %s uses an extension template, but does not have a parent component.
token_not_implemented=Not yet implemented: %s
redundant_embedded_component_types=Embedded component '%s' provides a type attribute in the template ('%s') \
                                   as well as in the component class ('%s'). You should not provide a type attribute \
                                   in the template when defining an embedded component within the component class.
recursive_template=The template for component %s is recursive (contains another direct or indirect reference to \
                   component %<s). This is not supported (components may not contain themselves).
composite_render_command_method_not_implemented=RenderQueue method %s() is not implemented for composited render commands.
exception_assembling_root_component=Exception assembling root component of page %s: %s
exception_assembling_embedded_component=Exception assembling embedded component '%s' (of type %s, within %s): %s
embedded_components_not_in_template=Embedded component(s) %s are defined within component class %s \
                                    (or a super-class of %s), but are not present in the component template (%s).
parameter_already_published=Parameter '%s' of embedded component '%s' can not be published as a parameter of component \
                            %s, as it has previously been published by embedded component '%s'.
failure_creating_embedded_component=Failure creating embedded component '%s' of %s: %s
published_parameter_nonexistant=Parameter '%s' of component %s is improperly published from embedded component '%s' \
                                (where it does not exist). This may be a typo in the publishParameters attribute of \
                                the @Component annotation.
