java-corpus
===========

Collection of open-source Java programs.
To compile any project, run the `compile.sh` script in each directory.
(The scripts for large projects often use auxillary files `COMPILE_ARGS`.)

Why
---

To provide a large collection of easy-to-compile code for running experiments.
Especially experiments that use alternative/modified Java compilers.
